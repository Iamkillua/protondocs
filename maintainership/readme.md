## Read before you apply

- MUST NOT get involved in ANY sort of ARGUMENT or RESORT TO INSULTS or use HATEFUL LANGUAGE or any sort of PERSONAL ATTACK.

- MUST upload a basic changelog for each build on the issue repository. They MUST be user friendly.

- MUST maintain authorship of EVERY git commit that is pushed, this is a mandatory requirement for ALL repositories

- SE for Android should be ENFORCING, without ignoring any neverallows.

- Builds should be the user variant. We only ship production builds.

- If there are commits required in the source base other than device-specific ones, they should be necessary for the device to build, boot or have a specific function. They must have proper authorship, as minimal and polished as possible, and shouldnâ€™t break any other device.

- Can't add any bloat.

- Kernel source SHOULD be public.

If you agree, PR to this [repo](https://github.com/protonplus-org/docs) after adding information of your device .
